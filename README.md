## Mobile data use during transport in Europe (Euromobile).
This project was made by four students (Lavoine Joseph, Gatineau Guillaume, Colin Martz and Amine Traore Ahmed) as part of the  [Datavisualisation course](https://lyondataviz.github.io/teaching/lyon1-m2/2019/) at [Universit√© Lyon 1](http://mastermas.univ-lyon1.fr/index.php/page1-2/). The main purpose of this visualisation is meant to help telecommunication companies to optimise both advertising and resources distribution. Last decades, internet use has exponentially increased around the world. The [Euromobile](https://gati23.github.io/Euromobile/) project is meant to give an efficient visualisation of this increase using the [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/fr/data/database) website's dataset. This dataset contains, from 2012 to 2018, the proportion of individuals using mobile data on the go (travelling, public transport...) sorted by country, age, genre and socio-professionnal category in Europe.
