## Mobile data use during transport in Europe (Euromobile).
This project was made in order to help telecommunication companies to optimise both advertising and resources distribution. Last decades, internet use has exponentially increased around the world. The [Euromobile]() project is meant to give an efficient visualisation of this increase using the [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/fr/data/database) website dataset. This dataset contains, from 2012 to 2018, the proportion of individuals using mobile data on the go (travelling, public transport...) sorted by country, age, genre and socio-professionnal category in Europe.
