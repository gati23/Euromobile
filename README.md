## Mobile data use during transport in Europe.
This project was made in order to help telecommunication companies to optimise both advertising and resources distribution. Last decades, internet use has exponentially increased around the world. The EuropeMobile project has for objective to give an efficient visualisation of this increase using the [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/fr/data/database) website dataset. This dataset contains, for the years 2012 to 2018, the proportion of individuals using mobile data during transport sorted by country, age, genre and socio-professionnal category in Europe.
